# Devtober, a post mortem

*Devtober* finished a week ago, and now is the time to look back on this whole month of coding.
You can read my original post [here](http://www.blog.tronica.io/climbing-the-tower).

## What happenned

### Scope

I knew from the begining I wouldn't be able to make the game I had in mind, so I reduced the scope to something I thought was manageable. It was still too much, and by the end of the month I was still far from my goals.
Let's go over my objectives:

- *All the basic movement*: running was implemented, and feels pretty satisfying. Neither jumping nor climbing are in the game;
- The *stamina mechanic* is not in the game;
- From the *three equipment* I planned on putting into the game, only the rope made it, and I don't feel like it's finihsed: as it took a central position in what I wanted to do, I don't feel it's in a satisfying state at the moment. As the focus changed during the month, this objective doesn't make as much sense;
- As for *Basic graphics*, I have a character sprite and a walking animation, which is not enough for the movement actually in the game, and no tileset for the environment;
- The *Camping mechanic* is not here either, as it makes sense only if stamina was implemented;
- There is no *title screen*, and no *menu* to launch the game or quit;
- My original plan to make a *procedurally generated tower* was abandonned when the idea for the game evolved, but I dont have any level design anyway.

So why how did it happen? Why is there so few items checked on this list?

### Time

My schedule only allowed me to work between half an hour to an hour a day during the week, and a bit more during the weekend. But we all know weekend were not made to work. In that time, it was hard to put together
